<h1>PAC-MAN</h1> 
Pac-Man is a classic arcade game that was first released in 1980. The game is played by maneuvering Pac-Man through a maze, eating pellets and fruits along the way while avoiding ghosts.
This is my version of the classic cult game, built using matrices with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to maneuver Pac-Man through the maze.
Eat all the candies and fruits on the board while avoiding the ghosts.
If Pac-Man comes into contact with a ghost, he will die and the game will end.
Each candy equals 1 point, Cherry equals 10 points.
Eat a Cookie, and for a short limited time, you are invulnerable and able to kill ghosts if you encounter them.
If you kill a ghost, it will return after a short time.
